Knowledge shortfalls on deep-sea habitats of the Southern Indian Ocean

This repository offers the code to carry out the analysis from the manuscript "The epitome of data paucity: Deep-sea habitats of the Southern Indian Ocean". Specifically, the code to conduct the bioregionalisation using network analysis (1.network_analysis), the code to calculate the completeness of our collated inventory (2.completeness_analysis); and the code to plot the main the figures (3.figures). Sometimes the code might not be the most efficient, but I believe in sharing the resources :)

Some occurrence data are confidential and cannot be published. The great majority of records at species level come however from the public databases OBIS, GBIF, NOAA Deep-sea Corals portal, and the Smithsonian Natural History Museum. Records from the literature come from Taylor and Rogers (2017). See Methods in the paper for further description of the data involved.
